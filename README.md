# PRODIGY_CS_02
Creating a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation

### OBJECTIVE
Developing a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. This will help perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images(this will change the image from its original look to something else, making it impossible to view some elements)

### SKILLS LEARNED
* Use of Python functions to manipulate images
* Mastered importing some functions into the Python work environment
* learnt how to make Python code work like an application with the simple call of a function
* learnt how to turn Python code into a Windows and Android application. 

### TOOLS

### STEPS/PROCESS
* I installed the pillow library with "pip install pillow"
* I import PILL and OS
* I created a function with the carry parameter of the image path, image output part, and the encryption key
* I convert the image to RGB mode and i define the pixel
* I iterate through the pixel
* I define a function to make the code work like an application
